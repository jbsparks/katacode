## Access the Jupyter Notebook 

This will show something like:
```
    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://localhost:9888/?token=f89b02dd78479d52470b3c3a797408b20cc5a11e067e94b8
```

The token is the value behind `/?token=`. You need that for logging in.

Next, you can open the Jupyter Notebook at 
 https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-9888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

Note: you need the value of the Jupyter Token to login to the environment.
